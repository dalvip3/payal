						<p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><b>-</b>Yesterday's Perfume The word perfume comes from the Latin phrase, “per” meaning “thorough” and “fumus” meaning “smoke”. The French later gave the name “parfum” to the smells produced by burning incense. Indeed, the first form of perfume was incense, first made by the Mesopotamians about 4000 years ago.<br><br>

						<b>-</b>It is the ratio of alcohol to scent that determines the perfume's strength and worth. The more essential oil, the stronger (and more expensive) the perfume is. Eau de parfum will have a lower concentration of alcohol while body mists will have a much higher concentration of alcohol.<br><br>
						<b>-</b>Many perfumes are made by extracting scented oil from natural ingredients. These ingredients can include various plants, fruits, woods and even animal secretions. Other resources like alcohol, coal, tars and petrochemicals can be used during the manufacturing process.
